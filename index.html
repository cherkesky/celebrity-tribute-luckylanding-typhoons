                    Queen Elizabeth II is the longest reigning monarch in British history. She became queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 6 February 1952 following the death of her father, King George VI (1895–1952). Largely known for her efforts to modernise the institution of monarchy- and of course for her love of corgis (she has owned more than 30 during her reign), Elizabeth has ruled for more than 60 years and has worked alongside many prominent figures in society including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. She currently resides in the United Kingdom splitting her time between Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Balmoral Estate in the Scottish Highlands. Elizabeth celebrated her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.
